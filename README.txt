This is the algorithm corresponding to the paper "Efficent computations of discrete cubical homology".

The program is coded in Julia and contained in the notebook Cubical_Homology_parallelized.ipynb. It requires the LinearAlgebra and SparseArrays packages.

Some instructions and example uses can also be found in the notebook.
